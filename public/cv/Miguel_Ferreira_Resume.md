## ABOUT

I've spent the last 10+ years designing B2B products in high-stakes environments: iGaming, localization, enterprise software. At Fast Track AI, I led design through 15x revenue growth while keeping NPS above 90. I've relocated across four countries and three continents, always landing in roles that needed someone comfortable with ambiguity, technical debt, and tight timelines. I can code enough to prototype and speak dev fluently, which makes cross-functional collaboration and tech-design alignment much smoother.

## WHERE I'M MOST USEFUL

- **Legacy systems under pressure:** Technical debt, tight capacity, scale-driven auditing.
- **Leveraging AI in production:** Shipped the first natural-language CRM in iGaming. Working with AI since 2017.
- **Multi-market complexity:** Localization that goes beyond translation: timezones, compliance, cultural nuance.
