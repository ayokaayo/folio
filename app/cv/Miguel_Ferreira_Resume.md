## ABOUT

Senior Product Designer with 10+ years building B2B SaaS and AI-driven products in iGaming, localization, and enterprise software. Led design through 15x revenue growth at Fast Track AI, supporting market expansion across South America and APAC while maintaining NPS 90+.

I've become very familiar with systems deep in design and technical debt. Fast deliveries, tight capacity, scope drift, legacy constraints. I know how to assess what's actually possible and ship anyway. I can code and "speak dev" fluently, which really helps when you're working closely with engineering teams.

Long tenure despite frequent relocations. Stability in chaotic environments.
