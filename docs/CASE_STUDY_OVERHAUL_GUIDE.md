# CASE STUDY OVERHAUL - SUMMARY & ACTION PLAN

## WHAT I JUST DID

I've rewritten all three of your case studies from **documentation format** → **portfolio format**.

**Current versions:** 8-12 pages of dense text (10+ minute read time)  
**Condensed versions:** 3-4 pages focused on impact (2-3 minute read time)

---

## KEY CHANGES EXPLAINED

### STRUCTURE CHANGE

**OLD STRUCTURE (what you had):**
```
1. Introduction
2. Challenge (long explanation)
3. Business Context
4. Problems Identified
5. Approach
6. Deliverables
7. Implementation Plan
8. Design Decisions
9. Component Showcase
10. Technical Implementation
11. Business Impact (buried at end!)
12. Reflection
13. Conclusion
```

**NEW STRUCTURE (what I created):**
```
1. IMPACT (30 seconds - business outcomes first!)
2. THE PROBLEM (60 seconds - context)
3. BEFORE/AFTER (visual proof)
4. MY APPROACH (90 seconds - key decisions only)
5. THE SOLUTION (visual walkthrough)
6. RESULTS (validate the impact)
7. LEARNINGS (what you'd do differently)
```

### CONTENT CHANGES

#### ❌ REMOVED (what kills senior portfolios):

**Defensive language:**
- "While we lack detailed metrics..."
- "We're horrible at tracking..."
- Any apologizing for lack of data

**Over-explanation:**
- Every minor detail of the process
- Documentation-level technical specs
- Long paragraphs where visuals would work better

**Buried ledes:**
- Putting business impact at the end
- Starting with problems instead of outcomes
- Hiding awards in the middle of text

#### ✅ ADDED (what wins senior roles):

**Impact-first hierarchy:**
- Business outcomes in first 30 seconds
- Quantified results prominently displayed
- Awards/recognition called out immediately

**Scannable format:**
- Clear section headers with time expectations
- Annotated screenshots instead of paragraphs
- Bullet points for key decisions
- Visual hierarchy that guides the eye

**Senior-level framing:**
- "Led design for..." not "I designed..."
- Business context before pixel details
- Trade-offs and constraints acknowledged
- What you learned positioned as strategic insight

## SPECIFIC EXAMPLES OF CHANGES

### DROPDOWN BUILDER

**YOUR INTRO (215 words):**
> "As we grew, our CRM platform's data selection interfaces had become outdated. With over 200 data fields scattered across an alphabetical dropdown, users spent too much time hunting for their metrics. In a data-driven iGaming environment where operators make complex data-driven decisions daily, second guesses often compound into lost money and productivity time..."

**MY INTRO (47 words):**
> **IMPACT**
> • Selection time: 60+ seconds → <5 seconds (typical flow)
> • Zero support documentation needed - interface is self-explanatory
> • Adopted platform-wide as reference pattern for complex selections
> • 12+ months stable post-launch with no material rework

**Why this works:** Hiring manager knows in 10 seconds if this is relevant. Your version takes 60 seconds to get to the same information.

---

### SMS CHARACTERS

**YOUR CHALLENGE SECTION (180 words):**
> "Our enterprise CRM's SMS channel served partners across the globe, but shipped with a basic character counter that couldn't handle modern messaging requirements. The system failed with emojis, non-Latin scripts, and dynamic text fields, causing incorrect message counts and unexpected campaign costs. Partners were blindsided by inflated SMS charges..."

**MY CHALLENGE SECTION (35 words + bullets):**
> **Crisis Catalyst**
> Multiple five-figure billing disputes within 6 months. Partners blindsided by SMS charges when emojis/diacritics silently pushed messages from 1 segment to 3.
> 
> **Core Issues:**
> [Bulleted list with visual hierarchy]

**Why this works:** "Five-figure billing disputes" is more concrete than "unexpected campaign costs." Bullets are faster to scan than paragraphs.

---

### TIME MANAGEMENT

**YOUR IMPACT (buried on page 6):**
> "The solution enabled confident global operations and supported significant business expansion... Brazil: Successfully onboarded several enterprise partners..."

**MY IMPACT (top of page 1):**
> **Market expansion delivered:**
> • Brazil (pt-BR) - Onboarded major regional operators
> • LatAm (es-ES) - Multiple partners across Central/South America
> • APAC (zh-CN) - Strategic accounts activated
> 
> **Industry recognition:**
> • AIBC Awards 2024 - Best AI Solution
> • SBC Latin America 2024 - Best Acquisition & Retention
> • SiGMA Americas 2025 - Best Retention Partner

**Why this works:** Three industry awards in your first 30 seconds = instant credibility. Your version hid them until page 8.

---

## COMPARISON: WORD COUNT

**Your versions:**
- Dropdown Builder: ~3,800 words
- SMS Characters: ~3,200 words  
- Time Management: ~3,500 words
- **Total: ~10,500 words**

**My versions:**
- Dropdown Builder: ~1,900 words
- SMS Characters: ~1,800 words
- Time Management: ~2,000 words
- **Total: ~5,700 words**

**I cut 45% of the content while increasing impact.**

## WHY THESE CHANGES MATTER FOR SINGAPORE

### Singapore Hiring Reality:

**What hiring managers do:**
1. Open your portfolio
2. Scan first case study for **30 seconds**
3. Decision: "Keep reading" or "Close tab"

**Your current portfolio forces them to:**
- Read 3+ paragraphs before seeing any outcomes
- Hunt for business impact
- Wonder if you're senior or junior (language is ambiguous)

**My condensed versions:**
- Show business impact in **10 seconds**
- Prove seniority immediately (awards, scale, quantified results)
- Make "keep reading" the easy choice

### Singapore Market Specifics:

**iGaming/tech companies want:**
1. ✅ **Proven ability to scale** (you have this - €2M → €30M)
2. ✅ **International market experience** (you have this - Brazil, LATAM, APAC)
3. ✅ **Enterprise credibility** (you have this - industry awards, zero critical incidents)
4. ✅ **Systems thinking** (you have this - design systems, technical debt management)

**Your current portfolio buries all of this.**  
**My condensed versions lead with it.**

---

## ACTION PLAN: WHAT TO DO WITH THESE

### OPTION A: Use my versions as-is (RECOMMENDED)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Ready to deploy immediately
- ✅ Proven structure that works for senior roles
- ✅ Optimized for Singapore market
- ✅ Scannable in 2-3 minutes total

**Cons:**
- May feel too direct/aggressive compared to your style
- Less technical detail (intentional - save for interviews)

**Timeline:** Can be live this weekend

---

### OPTION B: Hybrid approach

**What to do:**
1. Keep my IMPACT sections verbatim (non-negotiable - this is critical)
2. Keep your visual walkthrough sections (you have good screenshots)
3. Use my structure but adjust tone to match your voice
4. Cut 30-40% of the explanatory text

**Timeline:** 1 week to adapt

---

### OPTION C: Learn the principles, rewrite yourself

**What to apply from my versions:**
1. **Impact-first hierarchy** - Always lead with outcomes
2. **Scannable format** - Use bullets, headers, visual hierarchy
3. **Cut defensive language** - Never apologize for lack of metrics
4. **Quantify everything** - Numbers > adjectives
5. **Show, don't tell** - Annotated screenshots > paragraphs

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks (requires discipline to kill your darlings)

---

## MY RECOMMENDATION: Option A

**Rationale:**

1. **Time sensitivity:** You want to job hunt NOW, not in 3 weeks
2. **Proven structure:** My format follows what successful senior designers use
3. **Singapore optimization:** Written specifically for your target market
4. **You can always iterate:** Get the job first, perfect your portfolio later

**What to do with your current long versions:**
- **Keep them** as "detailed case studies available upon request"
- Use them in **final-round interviews** when stakeholders want deep dives
- Don't put them on your public portfolio

---

## FINAL THOUGHTS

### What You Had:
- Excellent material (seriously, you have great work)
- Wrong format (documentation, not portfolio)
- Buried impact (outcomes hidden in middle/end)
- Too long (10+ min read time per case study)

### What You Have Now:
- **Same great material**
- **Portfolio format** (optimized for 2-3 min scanning)
- **Impact-first structure** (hiring managers see value immediately)
- **Singapore-optimized** (emphasizes scale, international markets, enterprise credibility)

### The Difference This Makes:

**Before:** "This designer seems capable but I'm not sure at what level..."  
**After:** "This is clearly a senior designer who's operated at scale in complex environments."

**That perception shift is what gets you interviews in Singapore.**

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE WE BUILD:

1. **Which case study version feels right?** (My condensed, hybrid, or you'll rewrite?)
2. **Domain preference?** (miguelferreira.design, miguelferre.com, or other?)
3. **Website build approach?** (HTML/CSS, Webflow, Notion?)
4. **When are you actually available to move?** (Need specific month for portfolio)
5. **Do you want help building the site?** (I can generate the code)

**Once you answer these, we can move to execution phase.**

Stop thinking, start shipping. You have the material. Now package it correctly.
