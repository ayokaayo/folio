## EMERGENCY ADJUSTMENTS

### If life happens:

## WHAT TO DO RIGHT NOW

**Just answer these 3 questions:**

3. **Any adjustments to the plan?** (Swap order, add buffer days, change Week 2 approach?)

**That's it. Answer those 3, and we begin Day 1 when you're ready.**

No rush. We move at human speed, not AI speed.
