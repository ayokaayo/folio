## CRITICAL PATH (MINIMUM VIABLE)

If you're extremely time-constrained, here's the absolute minimum:

**Week 1 Minimum (6 hours total):**
- Day 1: Decisions (30min) ✓
- Day 2: Domain (30min) ✓
- Day 3: Resume (1hr) ✓
- Day 4: Pick 1 BEST case study only (1.5hr) ✓
- Skip Day 5 review

**Week 2 Minimum (4 hours total):**
- Day 6: Portfolio copy (1hr) ✓
- Day 7: Design direction (1hr) ✓
- Skip Days 8-10, use my defaults

**Week 3 Minimum (5 hours total):**
- Day 11: I build while you work on other stuff (0hr for you)
- Day 12: Review (1hr) ✓
- Day 13: LinkedIn (1hr) ✓
- Day 15: Launch (1hr) ✓

**Absolute minimum: 15 hours over 2-3 weeks = functioning portfolio**

Then you can add Case Studies #2 and #3 later while you're already applying.

## FLEXIBILITY BUILT IN

### If you need to go slower:
✅ Each week can become 7-8 days instead of 5  
✅ Add 2-3 buffer days between weeks  
✅ Total timeline becomes 4-5 weeks instead of 3  

### If you need to go faster:
✅ Combine Days 1+2 into one session  
✅ Do 2 case studies in one day (Days 4+6 combined)  
✅ Launch by Day 12 instead of Day 15  

### If life interrupts:
✅ Just tell me, we pause and resume  
✅ No judgment, no pressure  
✅ The work waits for you

- [ ] Your actual relocation timeline
- [ ] Domain choice
- [ ] Any factual errors in my resume draft

### Recurring inputs:
- [ ] Screenshots from Figma (Days 4, 6, 7)
- [ ] Reviews/approvals (every 1-2 days)
- [ ] Design preferences (Day 9)
- [ ] Final website review (Day 12)

### Total time from you:
- **15-20 hours over 3 weeks**
- **1-2 hours per day maximum**
- **Some days just 30 minutes**

## HOW TO USE THIS PLAN

### Daily routine:
1. Check which day we're on
2. Look at "Your tasks" for that day
3. Complete them (usually 30min - 1.5hr)
4. Send me an update: "Day X done, here's what I found/decided"
5. I respond with Day X+1 deliverables and instructions

### Weekly routine:
- **Monday:** Week kickoff, I send you the plan for this week
- **Tuesday-Thursday:** Execute daily tasks
- **Friday:** Weekly checkpoint, rest over weekend
- **Weekends:** No work (unless you want to get ahead)

### Communication:
- **You message me:** Anytime that works for you
- **I respond:** Within 24 hours (usually same day)
- **Format:** Casual, just tell me what's done and what you need

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I don't have time this week"
**Solution:** We pause and resume next week. The plan waits for you.

### "I'm stuck on Day X task"
**Solution:** Message me immediately, I'll either:
- Do it for you (if I can)
- Break it into smaller steps
- Find a workaround

### "I want to change my Day 1 decisions"
**Solution:** Totally fine. Just tell me what changed and why. We adjust.

### "The website builder isn't working"
**Solution:** I can switch you to a different option or do it all myself (HTML/CSS).

### "I'm not happy with how it looks"
**Solution:** We iterate. This is why we have review days built in.

---

## WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

### End of Week 1:
You have a domain, a killer resume, and 1 polished case study ready to show.

### End of Week 2:
All your content is written, designed, and approved. You could make a portfolio in PowerPoint if you wanted (but we'll build a real site).

### End of Week 3:
You have a live portfolio at your domain, your LinkedIn is updated, and you've sent your first applications to Singapore companies.

### Week 4+:
You're in the application rhythm. I research companies, write custom messages, you send them. Interviews start happening.
