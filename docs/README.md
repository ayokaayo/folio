## QUICK ANSWERS TO LIKELY QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I have to read all 9 files right now?**  
A: No. Just read DAY_1_STARTER_KIT.md and answer the questions. Everything else comes later.

**Q: What if I don't have time this week?**  
A: Tell me. We'll start next week. The plan waits for you.

**Q: Can I change the timeline?**  
A: Yes. It's flexible. Too fast? We slow down. Too slow? We speed up.

**Q: What if I don't like something you wrote?**  
A: We iterate. Every deliverable has a review step built in.

**Q: How much will this cost me?**  
A: Domain: ~$12/year. Website hosting: $0-20/month depending on builder choice. That's it.

**Q: Do I need to know how to code?**  
A: No. If you choose HTML/CSS option, I write all the code. You just review.

**Q: What about the Kaayo domain question?**  
A: We settled it: miguelferreira.design for job hunting, kaayo.studio for later (if you want).

**Q: When will I start getting interviews?**
