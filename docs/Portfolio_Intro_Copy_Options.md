# PORTFOLIO INTRO COPY OPTIONS

## CURRENT (WEAK):
"I have a flair for crafting remarkable experiences, and turning complicated processes into usability bliss."

❌ Problems:
- "Flair" = vague, junior language
- "Remarkable experiences" = meaningless buzzword
- "Usability bliss" = cringe-worthy marketing speak
- Zero concrete information about what you actually do
- Could be written by any designer with 0-10 years experience

## MY RECOMMENDATION: 

Use **Option 1**. 

Why:
✅ Concrete numbers immediately establish seniority
✅ "Currently seeking" creates urgency
✅ Shows business impact, not just design craft
✅ Singapore employers can immediately assess fit

---

## VISUAL LAYOUT SUGGESTION:

Keep it minimal. Don't over-design the intro.

```
[Small eyebrow text]

[Large heading]

[2-3 sentence paragraph, readable size]
I've spent 10+ years building B2B SaaS products...

## CRITICAL: 

Remove ALL fluffy language from your portfolio:
❌ "Flair"
❌ "Remarkable"  
❌ "Bliss"
❌ "Passionate about"
❌ "Love to"
❌ "Innovative"
❌ Any phrase a junior designer would use

Replace with:
✅ Numbers (revenue, growth, team size, NPS)
✅ Outcomes (awards won, markets launched, features shipped)
✅ Capabilities (what you can do, not how you feel about it)
✅ Context (industry, constraints, scale)

Senior designers show impact. Junior designers describe feelings.
